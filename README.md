# Data Science Portfolio

## [Project 1: Predicting seasonal flu and h1n1-flu vaccination rates](https://github.com/vrda23/Vaccination-ML)
- Exploratory data analysis (visualizations, correlations (Cramer's V))
- Dealing with missing data, data cleaning
- Applying classification algorithms using sklearn
- Connecting the whole procedure within sklearn's pipeline
- Creating meta models (Ensamble) to improve the roc_auc_score


## [Project 2: Breast-Cancer-classification](https://github.com/vrda23/Breast-Cancer-classification)

Machine learning project using an open-source database for breast cancer classification.

data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

In this project, I demonstrate the following:
- data cleaning (dropping missing values)
- feature engineering (encoding categorical variables)
- model building (logistic regression and random forest classifier)
- model evaluation (via precision and recall)
