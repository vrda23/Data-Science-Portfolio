# Vaccination-ML competition
ML project/competition from DrivenData for predicting flu vaccination rates.
The goal of this project is to predict the probability if a certain person will take the seasonal flu vaccine and/or bird-flu vaccine.

For this competition, there are two target variables:

- h1n1_vaccine - Whether respondent received H1N1 flu vaccine.
- seasonal_vaccine - Whether respondent received seasonal flu vaccine.
Both are binary variables: 0 = No; 1 = Yes. Some respondents didn't get either vaccine, others got only one, and some got both. This is formulated as a multilabel (and not multiclass) problem.
